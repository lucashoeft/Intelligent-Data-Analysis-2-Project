Projects

In the semester projects, you should try to apply everything you learned in the course. After choosing data set and a problem setting, you tackle it with machine learning methods. You will present the results in the exam. The time for your talk is 15 minutes. Following the presentation there will be a question session of approx. 15 minutes. The question session will contain everything from the lecture. If you use preimplemented Python methods, please read the documentation and be sure to understand how they work. For Machine Learning I, you find our suggestions for suitable data sets here in Moodle. For Machine Learning II, we suggest that you browse the Kaggle website.

Define a problem setting

First choose a data set. For your data analysis, you have to define a problem setting. Write this down formally. Find an appropriate category of learning problem(e.g., classification, regression, learning an embedding, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning). Define a target variable (label) and the input attributes. Examples of how to define a problem setting can be found in Machine Learning papers.

Get to know the data

It can be useful to perform some basic data exploration and visualization. Typical things to look at include but are not limited to: missing values (decide how to deal with them and provide a rationale for your decision) or the quantity of data for each label. In your presentation, do not spend a lot of time on descriptive statistics or visualizations of your data.

Machine Learning Methods

Develop a suitable approach that you feel reflects the state of the art. Also develop baseline methods. Whenever you build something complicated, it is interesting to study whether a simple solution without the complicated element works just as well. If the problem has no clear "best" approach, it makes sense to try out at least two approaches. Make sure that you are able to explain how all the methods that you use work.

Compare Approaches with the Same Evaluation Protocol

Choose evaluation metrics according to your problem setting and define an evaluation protocol. Be able to argue how your why your evaluation protocol is suitable Implement the evaluation protocol and compare both of your models. Interpret the results you obtained. For each model that uses hyper-parameters, please tune them in a reasonable scope and with a suitable protocol. If your local machine is not powerful enough, Google Colab gives free access to GPUs for up to 12 hours daily.

Presentation

Prepare a 15-minute presentation with your problem setting, analysis, methods, experiments, and conclusions. Your presentation does not need to enumerate all work packages, but it should present your conclusions concisely in the given time frame. We recommend that you prepare some slides, but it is not mandatory.

Implementation Submission

Please send a link to your git or a \recompiled notebook to each of the course instructors until the evening before the exam.
