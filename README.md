# Intelligent-Data-Analysis-2-Project

The final project for the course 'Intelligent Data Analysis & Machine Learning II' at the University of Potsdam. The given task was to apply learned methods from the course on a self-chosen data set from kaggle. I chose a data set of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of 10 classes with a total of 27k labeled images. The goal was to predict the right class labels for the given input images.

For prediction of the classes, I used a simple and an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) and the ResNet50 with transfer learning. As a result the pre-trained ResNet50 outperforms all other models by far.
